Sue
1. As a student, I want to be on time for my assignments so that I got good grades. 
2. As a busy person, I want to establish a routine so that I can maintain my consistency and build good habits.
3. As an office worker, I want to divide my tasks based on urgency and importance so that I don't miss out any important tasks.
